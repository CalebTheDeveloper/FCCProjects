          <h2>Early Life</h2>
          <p>Bolan's life was as follows:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>He was born</li>
            <li>He entered the United States Army Special Forces at age 18</li>
            <li>He has an older sister and a younger brother</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>The Military and Beyond</h2>
            <p>While Bolan was in his third tour of duty in Vietnam, he was thirty-years-old.  This is where <a id="tribute-link" href="https://mackbolan.com" target="_blank">his first book</a> begins.  He waged a one-man war against the mafia in the 1970s, went on to fight the Russians in the 80s, then switched to a global campaign of war against evil in all its forms.  He did not do this alone, of course!  He founded Stony Man, spearheading the fight there before switching to an arms-length relationship with them.  He still fights on, protecting the free world.</p>
